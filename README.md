# InsightsUBC

**InsightsUBC** is a full-stack application developed as part of UBC’s CPSC 310 course. It enables users to query and analyze academic data from UBC’s publicly available datasets, helping students explore grade trends and make more informed course decisions.

The backend is written entirely from scratch in TypeScript and the frontend was built using React.
